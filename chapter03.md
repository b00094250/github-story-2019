is a diary talking about various events which happened in my life.

Dear Diary,
        Today I was the day I would adopt a dog. I felt I need company in my house so I researched on dog kernel. I eventually found the adoption centre not too far from my location. 
The website had many dogs which were all nice but then I stumble upon this beautiful rottweiler 
puppy. There was something about this puppy that made me want to be part of his life.
I made sure I had the equipment needed for the dog like the bowl, food and toys. The next day I hopped into my car and started my journey 
to the adoption centre. It took two hours to get there. It was very stressful going through traffic. But I was expecting this especially when it was rush hours. 
I arrived at the place to see the manager outside waiting for me. Her name was Aoife. She introduced me to all the dogs in the kernel. After that I couldn't find the dog. I asked the 
for the dog but he was already taken. It was a shame. I went back to start looking  for a new place.
