Dear Diary,
            We just arrived in Madrid. The climate is very hot. We gathered our bags 
            got in a taxi to our hotel. It was a five star hotel which Thomas picked it. 
            It was a very good choice. I remember we were in the living room debating which 
            what was the best hotel to stay. The hotel's main hall had a beautiful design. 
            The shandilers looked aquiset. The hotel room was a on a different level to my bedroom
            . It had a balcony where I could see the whole beach. The next day we were sitting in front
            of the pool. The sun was high in the sky. Suncream was essential
