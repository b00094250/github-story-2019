Dear Diary, 

We arrived in Madrid. The climate is boiling. We gathered our bags got in a taxi to our hotel. It was a five-star hotel 
which Thomas picked it. It was a superb choice. I remember we were in the living room debating which what was the best 
hotel to stay. The hotelâ€™s main hall had a beautiful design. The chandeliers looked fantastic. The hotel room was on a 
different level to my bedroom . It had a balcony where I could see the whole beach. The next day we were sitting in 
front of the pool. The sun was high in the sky. Sun cream was essential I did not want to come back home sunburnt.
It is worst feeling ever, so I packed extra packed sun cream. After they did this, we ate ice-cream. We then had dinner 
and watch a comedy show. The food was amazing; we had lobster, something I never had before. The comedy show was great, 
I never laughed so hard I was almost crying. It was a brilliant day so far. Everything I was going well. I could not wait
 for the next day on our holiday in Madrid.
