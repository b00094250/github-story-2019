This a diary talking about various events which happened in my life.

August 22, 2010

Dear Diary,
            Today was I'm going on holidays to Spain. It is my first time leaving the country. 
            I always wondered how it was like in a different country. I was going with friends Tom and Frank. 
            We worked for almost the whole summer making enough money for this trip.
            I woke up at 6 am to prepare for the for our flight at 10. I always make sure I'm earlier so I 
            have time to properly get ready. I remember when I went on a school tour and I ended up being late because 
            my alarm didn't wake me up and in the end. My Mother dropped me at the airport and after I met up with my 
            friends. It was annoying waiting in the longest queue I have ever seen. It was Airport Security. Everyone
             has to go through Airport Security. They scan your bags through advanced technology to check any hazards 
             that may affect the aircraft. There was also a door like an object I had to do walkthrough in case I was 
             hiding something. After we arrived at the gate ready to board.
